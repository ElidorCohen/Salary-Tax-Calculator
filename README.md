# Salary Tax Calculator

This software serves as an interface for managing and calculating progressive tax for employees in a particular workplace. The calculation is performed according to the progressive tax calculation standard in Israel. With the assistance of the software, it will be easier and more efficient to keep track of the monthly tax reductions for a particular employee.

I made and wrote this software as a project that is part of the Software Engineering unit in Sami Shamoon college of Engineering.
